        description: 'One of the largest predators of the ancient sea, up to 6-10 meters long. Characterized by powerful jaws that could bite through the bones and shells of other fish. Instead of teeth, it had sharp bony plates that were renewed as they wore down. Was a top predator, preying on other fish, including shell and soft-bodied ocean dwellers. Most likely inhabited deep water and coastal areas. Fossil finds have been found in North America, Europe, and Morocco.'

        description: 'A small fish about 30-50 cm long. It had a flat body and a heavy carapace that protected the head and front of the body. It had long pectoral fins that helped it move along the bottom. Dwelt in shallow water, preferring freshwater or estuarine environments. Was a detritophage, feeding on organic debris, sometimes small animals. Fossil finds are found throughout the world, including Australia, Europe, North America, and Asia.'

        description: 'The great white shark, also known as the carcharodon, is one of the most famous and impressive predators of the oceans. Length: Usually reaches between 4 and 6 meters, although specimens up to 7 meters have been recorded. Weight: 680 to 1,200 kg, but some specimens can weigh up to 2,000 kg. Color: The back and sides are dark gray or blue, while the belly is white. This coloration provides camouflage: the shark blends in with the water when viewed from above and with the bright sky when viewed from below.',

        description: 'Length: Adult pyloras can reach a length of 5-7 meters, depending on the species. Weight: On average weigh from 300 to 500 kg, large specimens may be heavier. Snout: The main feature is a long snout (up to 1/4 of the body length) with teeth on the sides, resembling a saw. It is used for hunting and defense. Body: Long and flat, with broad pectoral fins, giving the fish the shape of a stingray. Color: The back is dark gray or brown and the belly is light, which helps camouflage it in the water.',

        description: 'Characteristics: One of the most studied genera. Length: about 20-30 cm. Had a small head with little or no teeth, indicating feeding on plankton. Features: Had long and thin spines in front of the fins. The body was streamlined, which helped it move easily in the water. Habitat: Occurred in fresh and brackish water bodies. Fossil finds have been found in Europe, Asia, and North America.',

        description: 'Characteristics: One of the more predatory members of the class. Length: up to 1 meter. Had sharp teeth, indicating a diet of fish and large invertebrates. Features: Powerful jaws and large spines made it an active predator. Habitat: Occurred in the seas, predominantly in coastal areas. Interesting fact: Considered a transitional form between early jawed vertebrates and modern fish.',
